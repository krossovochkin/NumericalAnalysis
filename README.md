NumericalAnalysis
=================

**Couple of algorithms of numerical analysis in Java language:**
* Iteration method solving system of linear algebraic equations
* Gauss's method solving system of linear algebraic equations
* Rotation method of finding eigen values of a matrix
* Danilevsky's method of finding one eigen value of a matrix and corresponded to it eigen vector
* Counting matrix determinant and its inverse matrix
